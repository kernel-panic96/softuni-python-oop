### Running the application

You have to install matplotlib and pyspectator

Execute in the terminal tab
```
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install pyspectator
```

If that does not work try installing the same packages from your IDE
Additionally, you'll have to make your own test email following [this guide](https://realpython.com/python-send-email/#option-1-setting-up-a-gmail-account-for-development)
and setting the username and the password accordingly in the `email_sender.py` file
